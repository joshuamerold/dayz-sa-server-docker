# Docker Image for DayZ Standalone Server  
  
> Currently only Experimental Server since linux server is not yet released to stable
  
### Run the image  

The default startup command will update/install the server using the steamcmd (with anonymous login).  
  
Everything steam cmd downloads will be located in the `/dayz/server` directory, so make sure to create a volume for this dir or map it to the host file system.
  
Example:  
```
docker run -d -P \\
    -v "${PWD}:/dayz/server" \\
    --restart unless-stopped \\
    senfo/dayz-sa-server-docker \\
```
